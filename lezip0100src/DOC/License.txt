    code of unRAR program.
    All copyrights to original unRAR code are owned by Alexander Roshal.

    The license for original unRAR code has the following restriction:

    The unRAR sources cannot be used to re-create the RAR compression algorithm, 
    which is proprietary. Distribution of modified unRAR sources in separate form 
    or as a part of other software is permitted, provided that it is clearly
    stated in the documentation and source comments that the code may
    not be used to develop a RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver.
